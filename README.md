### General Overview:
[**Welcome to Starlight**](https://curegoh.github.io/) is a simple webpage to introduce myself and my cosplay hobby. Through this project, I aim to connect with other like-minded people who share similar interests.

### Tech Stack:
With the basic knowledge I have gained over the weeks of learning the CS50 modules, I have developed the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Boostrap 5 as a framework. 

The project consists of 4 simple directories for the users to navigate.
1. The home page
2. 'About Me' page
3. 'Interests' page
4. 'Pictures' page

### The Home page
The Home page serves as the initial starting point for visitors to the 'Starlight' website. Here, the primary focus is to provide a warm welcome and introduce the purpose of the website. It sets the tone for the entire browsing experience by offering a glimpse into what visitors can expect to find on the site. 
#### Design choice:
The design of the Home page is intended to be inviting and engaging, encouraging users to explore further. The use of a background image showcasing the starry night and a female anime character from Starlight complements each other and really sets a inviting mood for the audience to explore the website further. 

### About Me page
In this, visitors may find a brief introduction of me. This introduction include details such as the origin of my nick name, a fun fact or interesting tidbit to capture the reader's attention. This introductory section sets the stage for the deeper exploration of the creator's cosplay journey that follows. It aims to provide a quick summary of myself to intrigue visitors to further explore the page.
#### Design choices:
Several design choices were made for this. But I ultimately decidedd to go for the minimalistic white page background with minimal text for the readers to absorb the contents of my introduction. This is to facilitate understanding and interests of me, the creator of the webpage. Now, to avoid it being too plain, I've included a picture of a cartoon drawing at the side, together with a link to my social media for others to connect with me. 

### Interests page
The "Interests" page on the Starlight website is a dedicated section where I shares my broader interests and passions beyond cosplay. This page serves as a platform for me to showcase various aspects of my personality, hobbies, and the diverse range of topics that inspire them. Through a combination of textual content, images, and potentially multimedia elements, the "Interests" page offers visitors a deeper insight into my multifaceted interests (pharmacy and chemistry) and serves as a means of connection with like-minded individuals.
#### Design choices:
I ultimately went for a background with chemical apparatuses to bring the attention to the main focus of this section: I like pharmacy. Using a lighter shade of blue, I've implemented the write up on my interests on this section so as to complement the background. 

### Pictures page
Lastly, the picture page is a visual showcase of my cosplay creations and experiences. This section serves as a gallery where visitors can browse through a collection of photographs capturing the essence and artistry of the my cosplay endeavors. The "Pictures" page offers visitors a window into the world of cosplay and allows them to appreciate the craftsmanship, creativity, and passion that goes into each costume and portrayal.
#### Design choices:
I went ahead with a table design so as to organize data better. I really like this clean format as visitors can really appreciate the similarity of the cosplay compared to the character side by side, perhaps giving me tips on some areas I can work on!

### Future plans for my website:
I plan to update this website from time to time, especially so when I attend a new anime convention and cosplay as a different character. It will be my page to showcase my personal achievements in terms of coding and in terms of cosplay! It will be my personal gallery to flaunt to other fellow cosplayers, and I hope it will gain traction and garner feedback for both my cosplay skills and my coding skills.

### Last words
I thank CS50 for this amazing opportunity to learn code. This journey was definitely not easy, but fun and rewarding nonetheless. Having the creativity to build our own project and to see the results of our actions, is to me, extremely fulfilling and an eye-opener.
