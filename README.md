#### Description:
[**Welcome to Starlight**](https://curegoh.github.io/) is a simple webpage to introduce myself and my cosplay hobby. Through this project, I aim to connect with other like-minded people who share similar interests.

The project consists of 4 simple directories for the users to navigate.
1. The home page
2. 'About Me' page
3. 'Interests' page
4. 'Pictures' page

#### Tech Stack:
With the basic knowledge I have gained over the weeks of learning the CS50 modules, I have developed the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Boostrap 5 as a framework.
