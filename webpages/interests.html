            <p style='font-family: "Comic Sans MS"'>
                Other than anime I also enjoy delving into the field of <u> pharmaceutical science </u>. Pretty different huh hehe? </p>
                <p style='font-family: "Comic Sans MS"'>
                    I've always had a strong interest in both healthcare and science, and pharmacy uniquely bridges these two passions.
                <br> <br> My fascination began during a high school chemistry class where I was captivated by the complexities of chemical interactions and their potential to affect human health. This led me to volunteer at a local pharmacy, where I saw firsthand the pivotal role pharmacists play in patient care.
                <br> <br> I was particularly inspired by the way the pharmacists not only dispensed medication but also offered advice and support to each patient, ensuring they felt informed and cared for.
                <br> What solidified my desire to pursue this career was the opportunity I had to assist in a community health campaign focused on diabetes management.
                It was there that I truly understood the impact of effective medication management and patient education. The chance to directly contribute to improving patients’ health outcomes is deeply rewarding to me.
                <br> <br> <strong> I am eager to bring my dedication and passion for pharmacy to a role where I can continue making a tangible difference in patients’ lives.
                </strong> </p>
